# Course Maker Pro

> A Course Authoring WordPress Theme from brandiD

## Description
Lead your LifterLMS online classes with style, organization and the most user-friendly course interface in the StudioPress / Genesis suite, which can be customized to reflect your style and sensibility.

The homepage layout will drive traffic to your site and engage users with your course materials while communicating that you're an authority in your space, without actually saying that â€” unless you want it to!

The Course Maker Pro theme, built exclusively for the Genesis framework, is packed full of features and functionality to help you market your new online course. We like it so much, we use it for our own personal branding course!

Course Maker Pro is a Child theme for the [Genesis framework](https://www.studiopress.com/features/), and integrates directly with [LifterLMS](https://lifterlms.com), the leader in WordPress Learning Management Systems.
